            <h2>Dr. Abdul Hafid Bukhari</h2>
            <h3>Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences</h3>
            <p>The Faculty of Engineering Sciences in Brega was established in 2015, and since its inception until today, the college has continuously strived with determined and vigorous steps to reach the highest ranks in terms of educational excellence. This pursuit is driven by our deep belief in our noble educational and training mission, which we see bearing fruit in our students in the best possible way.</p>

            <p>The first challenge lies in the college’s focus on the quality of education in all its aspects, adopting new plans and updating old ones, while relying on educational programs with a strong scientific foundation—programs that qualify graduates to become highly competent engineers capable of competing in the job market and serving in all oil institutions and other government sectors, in accordance with international standards.</p>

            <p>On behalf of myself and all my colleagues at the college, I would like to affirm that our policy is one of unity and shared spirit, and that success at this college is a success for all its members—students, faculty, and administrative staff alike. Therefore, we have worked and will continue to work diligently to achieve the best. Our mission and ambition know no bounds.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, we ask Allah Almighty to grant us all success in contributing to the service of this beloved country and in preparing distinguished generations of highly qualified engineers who are capable of playing a vital role in the nation’s development.</p>
